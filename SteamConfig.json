	"description": "Allows your colonists to remember their position during base defense. You can send off your colonists to their positions with a single click. Also provides keys to quickly create and select groups of colonists for easier control in battle.\n\nContains Basic and Advanced mode- Advanced allows to save up to 4 defensive positions per colonist. Great for multiple base entrances and fall-back lines of defense.\n\nCan be safely added to existing games.\n\n[b]Notice:[/b] The HugsLib library mod must also be installed. Make sure both are enabled in the Mods menu and HugsLib is loaded first. \n\nThe in-game description contains a brief guide. To get more info, discuss features or provide feedback, please visit the official forum thread: \nhttps://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=25535\n\nHope you enjoy.\n\nThe B19 version is still available, and can be found here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1535871209]Defensive Positions (B19)[/url]\n\nMy other mods: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962]HugsLib[/url] · [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962]Allow Tool[/url] · [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761315214]Map Reroll[/url] · [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761379469]Remote Tech[/url]",
