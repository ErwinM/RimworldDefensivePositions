Also provides keys to quickly create and select groups of colonists for easier control in battle.\n\nContains Basic and Advanced mode- Advanced allows to save up to 4 defensive positions per colonist. Great for multiple base entrances and fall-back lines of defense.\n\nCan be safely added to existing games.\n\n[b]Notice:[/b] The HugsLib library mod must also be installed. Make sure both are enabled in the Mods menu and HugsLib is loaded first. \n\nThe in-game description contains a brief guide.
