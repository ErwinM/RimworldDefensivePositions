	<description>&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
Allows your colonists to remember their position during base defense. You can send off your colonists to their positions with a single click.
		
&lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Set defensive positions for colonists&lt;/b&gt;
1) Draft your defenders and place them where you want them.
2) With your defenders selected, hold the Shift key and click the Defensive position button (or press T).
Done. The selected colonists will remember their held positions.

&lt;b&gt;Send colonists to saved positions&lt;/b&gt;
1) Select your defenders.
2) Click the Defensive position button (or press T).
Your defenders will be drafted and will run to their saved positions.

&lt;b&gt;Advanced mode&lt;/b&gt;
Hold the Alt key and click the Defensive position button to switch between basic and advanced mode.
Advanced mode works exactly like Basic, but you have 4 positions to work with. Shift+click a slot to save a position, just click to send the selected pawns to the position they have been assigned under that number.
Pressing T is the same as clicking the first slot.
